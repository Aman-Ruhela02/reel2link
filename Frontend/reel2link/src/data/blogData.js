If your affiliate links are not clickable inside Instagram captions, you are not alone.

Instagram does not support clickable URLs inside reel or post captions. This forces creators to reply manually with links or redirect users to bio.

This causes:
• Lost affiliate commissions  
• Poor user experience  
• Time wasted replying “Link in bio”  

Reel2Link solves this problem.

Simply paste the Instagram link into the tool and get a clean version of the caption where all URLs become clickable.

Now you can share that version anywhere — WhatsApp, Telegram, email, or website.

Stop losing commissions.
Start converting better.
